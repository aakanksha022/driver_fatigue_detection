# driver_fatigue_detection
Driver fatigue detection is a project built using Dlib and OpenCV with Python.
A computer vision system that can automatically detect driver drowsiness by tracking closing of eyes and yawing in a real-time video stream and then alert if the driver appears to be drowsy.
The project includes direct working with the 68 facial landmark detector and also the face detector of the Dlib library.
